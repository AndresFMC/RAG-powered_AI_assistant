## Test 1: Namespace Isolation

**Objective:** Verify that each country only retrieves documents from its own namespace.

**Test Query:** "What is the probation period?"

**Results:**

| Country  | Sources Retrieved | Isolation Status |
|----------|------------------|------------------|
| Spain    | 02_spain_labor_regulations.pdf (3x) | ✓ PASS |
| Poland   | 02_poland_labor_regulations.pdf (3x) | ✓ PASS |
| Colombia | 02_colombia_labor_regulations.pdf (3x) | ✓ PASS |
| Italy    | 02_italy_labor_regulations.pdf (2x)<br>01_italy_general_hiring_guide.pdf (1x) | ✓ PASS |
| Georgia  | 02_georgia_labor_regulations.pdf (3x) | ✓ PASS |

**Conclusion:** 100% namespace isolation achieved. No cross-contamination detected.

## Test 2: Edge Cases & Error Handling

### Test 2.1: Invalid Country

**Input:**
```json
{"country": "france", "question": "test"}
```

**Expected:** Error message with supported countries  
**Result:** ✓ PASS
```
"Invalid country. Supported: spain, poland, colombia, italy, georgia"
```

### Test 2.2: Empty Question

**Input:**
```json
{"country": "spain", "question": ""}
```

**Expected:** Validation error  
**Result:** ✓ PASS
```
"Missing required fields: country and question"
```

### Test 2.3: Irrelevant Question

**Input:**
```json
{"country": "spain", "question": "What is the capital of France?"}
```

**Expected:** Acknowledge lack of relevant information  
**Result:** ✓ PASS
```
"The information about the capital of France is not provided in the given context..."
```

**Conclusion:** Error handling works correctly for all edge cases.

## Test 3: Performance Metrics

### Cold Start (Lambda inactive for 10+ minutes)
- **Total Time:** 8-12s
- **Breakdown:**
  - Lambda container initialization: ~6-9s
  - Embedding generation: ~0.5s
  - Pinecone search: ~0.3s
  - LLM generation: ~1.2-2s

### Warm Start (Immediate subsequent request)
- **Total Time:** 2-4s
- **Breakdown:**
  - Embedding generation: ~0.5s
  - Pinecone search: ~0.3s
  - LLM generation: ~1.2-3.2s

### Analysis
- Cold start time typical for Lambda container images with heavy dependencies (langchain, boto3, pinecone)
- Warm start performance excellent (<5s target)
- Container image size optimized but initialization overhead expected
- Lambda 2048MB memory appropriate for workload
- Performance varies based on AWS region load and Bedrock API availability

**Conclusion:** Performance meets requirements for demo/PoC. Cold starts can be eliminated in production with Lambda provisioned concurrency.

## Test 4: Frontend End-to-End

**URL Tested:** `https://rag-powered-ai-assistant-frontend.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/index.html`

### Functional Tests

| Test Case | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Country selector displays all 5 countries | ✓ PASS | Dropdown functional |
| Question input accepts text | ✓ PASS | No character limits issues |
| Submit button activates | ✓ PASS | Gradient styling correct |
| Loading state displays | ✓ PASS | Spinner animation smooth |
| Answer displays correctly | ✓ PASS | Formatting preserved |
| Sources section populates | ✓ PASS | File names + scores visible |
| Multiple queries work | ✓ PASS | No state issues |
| Browser console clean | ✓ PASS | No CORS errors |

### Cross-Country Query Test

Tested one question per country to verify diversity of responses:

- **Spain:** "What are mandatory bonuses?" → Answer specific to Spanish aguinaldo
- **Poland:** "Types of employment contracts?" → Answer lists Polish contract types
- **Colombia:** "Minimum wage?" → Answer provides Colombian salary info
- **Italy:** "Probation period for technicians?" → Answer cites Italian law specifics
- **Georgia:** "Maximum working hours?" → Answer references Georgian regulations

**Conclusion:** Frontend fully functional with no errors.

## Test 5: Index Statistics

**Endpoint:** `POST /query` with `{"action": "stats"}`

**Results:**
```json
{
  "total_vectors": 231,
  "namespaces": {
    "georgia": { "vector_count": 43 },
    "poland": { "vector_count": 46 },
    "colombia": { "vector_count": 49 },
    "italy": { "vector_count": 44 },
    "spain": { "vector_count": 49 }
  },
  "countries": ["spain", "poland", "colombia", "italy", "georgia"]
}
```

**Verification:**
- Total vectors: 231 ✓ (matches expected: 49+46+49+44+43)
- All 5 namespaces present ✓
- Vector distribution logical ✓ (proportional to document size)

**Conclusion:** Index properly populated with correct namespace distribution.

## System Configuration Verified

| Component | Configuration | Status |
|-----------|--------------|--------|
| Vector DB | Pinecone Serverless (us-east-1) | ✓ Active |
| Embeddings | Bedrock Titan v2 (1024 dims) | ✓ Working |
| LLM | Claude 3.5 Sonnet | ✓ Working |
| Lambda | 2048MB, 300s timeout | ✓ Optimal |
| API Gateway | REST API, CORS enabled | ✓ Functional |
| Frontend | S3 Static (HTTPS) | ✓ Accessible |

---

## Known Limitations

1. **Cold Start Latency:** 8-12s initial response (acceptable for demo, can be eliminated with Lambda provisioned concurrency)
2. **API Key Protection:** Basic API Gateway key authentication (intentional for demo)
3. **Rate Limiting:** Basic throttling via API Gateway usage plans (200 req/day)
4. **Caching:** No response caching (could reduce costs and latency in production)

---

## Recommendations for Production

1. Enable Lambda provisioned concurrency to eliminate cold starts
2. Add CloudWatch alarms for Lambda errors and latency spikes
3. Enable X-Ray tracing for detailed performance analysis
4. Implement response caching (Redis/ElastiCache) for common queries
5. Add CloudFront distribution for global HTTPS delivery
6. Implement OAuth 2.0 authentication for enterprise deployment
